<h2>Hello</h2>
<b>I am TheVortex; a discord.js developer.</b> When not doing anything else, I build Discord bots (that's right, I'm that guy).

In early December 2018, in the middle of a long night coding (I believe I was on Discord for 15 hours straight), I had the inspiration to do something I'd wanted to do for a long time.

Back in the day, I started a bot-based meme (with pictures and all) and I wanted to do it again, with a different idea, just for the heck of it. For the time being, I called it TheVortex: the Discord Meme Bot.

I thought I'd post it as a reference here, and then when I get around to creating another bot, maybe I'll write up a more complete article on what's involved in doing something like this, and maybe even how to approach it from the beginning.

Update: You can also check out the Discord code here on GitHub.

Update: Updated with the new version that supports gifs and animated memes.

Update: A new version of TheVortex has been released! Click here to read about it and read the instructions.

<u>What is TheVortex?</u>

TheVortex is a bot that allows you to post memes on Discord. They're memes, or rather, memes that look like they come from Discord, with words and GIFs. So you can post memes such as the "D'oh!" ones, the "L"

<u>Context</u>

Funny enough, the about me above is all made up by a friend. Also remember, TheVortex: the Discord Meme bot is coming to a <strike>theatre</strike> <b><i>server*</i></b> near you!
